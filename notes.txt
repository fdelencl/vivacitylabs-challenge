about the hash problem:
I find my solution quite slow. this problem calls for multiprocessing or eventually gpu acceleration.
Javascript doesn't really excel at those problems. Or maybe I'm wrong.
The 3rd file will time out.
I took it to more than 2 billion, it took way too long and the solution was still not found.

about the path problem:
Since the objective was to use a library I used pathfinding.js.
it appeared quite easy to use.
For the algorythm I used Dijkstra as it is reliable in finding the quickest path and the easiest to implement.
On the other hand, it is not the fastest.

about the scrabble problem:
This one was way harder.
I first tried to implement an algorythm where I would have filtered words from the dict.
It was a terrible idea and I ended up scraping what I had done.
On the second try I decided to bruteforce the problem.
It ended up working fairly well as the only difficulty was to write a function that would detect illegal moves exhaustively
I tried to filter the dict as much as I could and then tried to put every word on each box of each line and column.
On my computer, it found the solution in around 2 seconds.
